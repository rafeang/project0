                        Purple Rain is epic. This song is one of the greats. It's raw and emotional and grand and I don't think I'll ever get tired of listening to it.
                        It is Prince's definitive power ballad, combining elements of "rock, gospel, R&B and orchestral music". 
                        And it's one of the longest songs ever: 8 minutes and 40 seconds. It's like a movie in itself with multiple acts.
                        <br><br>
                        The song starts off slow and soulful with a lone guitar and heavy, echo-ey drum beats. It is quickly accompanied 
                        with a grand electric piano. The choir joins in during the chorus and somehow it sounds both jazzy and gospel-like at the same time.
                        It's the sort of stuff that makes you feel like swaying from side to side and throw your hands in the air. Nearing the last few
                        verses Prince's voice gets more pained and desperate and you feel the bittersweet emotions in his voice. Then, like a roller coaster
                        nearing its highest elevation, the electric guitar ramps up the tension and suddenly it all comes hurtling down into one of the 
                        most EPIC guitar solos ever. I'm not exaggerating. And when Prince joins in with his soaring falsetto... You really feel like you're
                        dancing in the Purple Rain. This part ends violently with crashing, cascading drums and then the song tapers off with a piano and orchestral strings.
                        <br><br>
                        Prince describes the meaning of the song as "being with the one you love and letting your faith/god  
                        guide you through the purple rain." He elaborated on the meaning of "purple rain": "When there's blood
                        in the sky... red and blue = purple. Purple rain pertains to the end of the world." And that's 
                        exactly what I picture when I listen to the song. To me this song is about the pain of a failed relationship
                        overshadowed by the nearing of the apocalypse: At the end of times, nothing really matters. Whatever
                        happened with an ex-lover is all in the past. You just want to be with him/her, watching
                        the world end; holding hands in the purple rain. It's goodbye and hello, thank you and sorry, surrender 
                        and resistance; all together. It's rapturous and rhapsodic.
                        <br><br>
                        To show you a sense of what I mean, here's a video of Prince's legendary halftime performance 
                        at the Superbowl in 2007 (it actually rained for real).
