                        I fell in love with this song the first time I heard it on Spotify (God bless you recommendations algorithm).
                        Few songs convey such a pure, comforting and sincere message of love as Songbird does. 
                        <br><br>
                        The backing track is simple yet soulful and comprises just two instruments: a piano and an acoustic guitar. 
                        The pristine, crystal-clear piano takes center stage as it starts off the song and is supported by the soft cradling of the guitar. 
                        Christine McVie's voice simultaneously embody tenderness and strength at the same time.
                        <br><br>
                        Christine McVie actually wrote this song herself when the band was going through hard times.
                        During that period longtime couples in the band were breaking up. According to McVie, the song
                        is about how much the members mean to her and her desire for them to keep singing and playing together.
                        Aww!
                        <br><br>
                        Personally, I listen to this song sometimes when I'm feeling down or having trouble going to sleep with all the thoughts in my head.
                        Songbird is a lullaby, a prayer and a love letter. It moves me to no end.
