                        I. Love. Coldplay. If I had to list down my top 30 favourite songs I think a quarter of them would belong to Coldplay.
                        I chose this song in particular to feature because it's somewhat uplifting in it's own way and celebrates the underdogs,
                        outsiders and outcasts of the world. But there's a pretty sad story behind it.
                        <br><br>
                        This song is actually a tribute to Scott Hutchinson, the lead singer of a band called Frightened Rabbit,
                        who took his life in May 2018 after a long struggle with depression and anxiety. Champion Of The World
                        was inspired by Scott's song "Los Angeles, Be Kind", and you can hear the distinct similarity in the
                        intro parts of both songs. The song was released on November 20th, which would have been Scott's 38th birthday.
                        <br><br>
                        It is interesting to hear the parallel stories of both songs. Chris Martin, the lead singer
                        of Coldplay, has said that "Champion Of The World" is the song that comes from "following the other path",
                        as opposed to the one Scott took. 
                        <br><br>
                        To me this song is about failure and not being enough. Sometimes you try your hardest to do something,
                        but it just doesn't work out the way you imagined it to be. Life's tough that way. Still, it's about refusing to give up.
                        There's a heartwrenching line in the song which encapsulates this: <i>Oh referee, don't stop the fight, everyone can see I'm hurt..</i>
                        <br><br>
                        But, ultimately there is some comfort in music and imagination and dreams. There's a certain 
                        sense of relief and respite, especially in the part that goes: <i>in my dreams, onto my chest, she'll pin the colours
                        and say: 'I wandered the whole wide world but baby, you're the best'.</i>
